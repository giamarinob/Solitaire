# üÉè Solitaire Agent

This is a Python implementation of Klondike Solitaire, designed to support interaction with a reinforcement learning (RL) agent. The game includes support for human-readable commands, scoring, win/loss conditions, and a timer-based mechanic for evaluating agent performance.

## Features

- Full Klondike Solitaire game logic
- Draw-3 rule from the stock
- Scoring system based on classic Solitaire rules
- Undo functionality (single-step)
- Game timer (5-minute countdown)
- Deterministic win detection
- Command loop for human or AI play
- Designed with RL training in mind

## Scoring Rules

| Action                             | Points   |
|------------------------------------|----------|
| Waste ‚Üí Tableau                    | +20      |
| Tableau ‚Üí Foundation               | +100     |
| Waste ‚Üí Foundation                 | +120     |
| Foundation ‚Üí Tableau               | ‚àí100     |
| Recycle Waste                      | ‚àí20      |
| Auto-finish (deterministic win)   | +100 per card in tableau |

## Timer & Bonus

The game includes a 5-minute timer. If the agent finishes early or quits, a time-based bonus is awarded:

Time Bonus = Seconds Remaining √ó Foundation Multiplier

## Undo

Supports undoing the most recent move only. Game state (cards, score, etc.) is deep-copied to preserve fidelity.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- No external dependencies

### Run the Game

```bash
python main_manual.py
```

## TODO
- Implement additional win conditions.
- Add more complex AI behavior.
- Improve user interface (UI) and game interaction.
- Support saving and loading game state.
- Add more detailed documentation for the game and agent.
